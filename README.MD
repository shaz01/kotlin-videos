Hello! I'm Olcay. I'm 19 and I've been coding in Kotlin for around 4 years now. I'm studying CS in Ozyegin University. This is my app for the KotlinConf competition.

Before building this app, I was experimenting with rendering Compose into videos instead onto the screen. I think Compose has untapped potential to be useful on video creation, so I made a library that turns ordinary Compose code into videos. From there this idea of a simple stick-figure animator came into my head as a fun experiment. I've been building this in my spare time for 2 months now. The result is a lightweight Pivot‑style animation tool. It has keyframes with linear inbetweening, onion-skin previews, video exporting.

Technologies I used:
- Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform, currently with JVM and Android targets, but open to expanding when I have more time.
- Decompose for navigation
- Molecule
- Custom gradle convention plugins
- FileKit for managing files
- Skia and FFmpeg for rendering videos (on JVM)

Hope you find using it as fun as I found building it.
